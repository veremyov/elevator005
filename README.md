In general, there are floors on which people stand, and there are floors that they need. 
The elevator rises on the floors and carries people. The number of people on the floors is fixed, 
and the people themselves are randomly distributed over the floors. Indicates the number of people 
who can ride the elevator at a time. And the number of floors is given. The elevator works until 
he takes all. The elevator stops on each floor. I drove up to the top, downstairs, also stopped on 
each floor. Elevator and people are different flows.
